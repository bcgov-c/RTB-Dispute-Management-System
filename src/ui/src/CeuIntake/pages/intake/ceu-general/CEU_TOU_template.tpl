        <p>In order to submit information on the Complaints portion of the Dispute Management System to the RTB Compliance and Enforcement Unit ("<b>CEU</b>"), you must enter your "Basic BCeID" (which may be obtained at the following link:&nbsp;<a href="javascript:;" class="static-external-link" url="https://www.bceid.ca/register/basic/account_details.aspx?type=regular&eServiceType=basic">BCeID - Basic BCeID: Registration</a>) as well as the single-use token ("<b>Token</b>") provided by the RTB to the submitting party (the "<b>Submitter</b>"). Subsequent access is generally not permitted but, if permitted, any subsequent access will require a new Token. By using a Token to log into the CEU complaint portal, you are representing that you are the Submitter or the authorized representative of the Submitter with the authority to submit information on their behalf.</p>
        <p>You must adhere to any security policies, standards or procedures issued by the RTB in relation to your use of a Token and the CEU.</p>
        <p>The Submitter is solely responsible and liable for maintaining the security of the Token and any other login information. You will not: a) permit any unauthorized person to access your Token; b) divulge, share or compromise your Token; c) use or attempt to use the Token or login information of any other person unless you are their authorized representative; d) test or examine the security related to your or any other person's Token; e) take any action that might reasonably be construed as compromising, altering or rendering ineffective the Dispute Management System; or f) decompile, disassemble or reverse engineer the CEU complaint portal.</p>
        <p>You must immediately notify the RTB if you discover that your Token has been lost, stolen or compromised or if your User Account has been accessed without authorization.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>All User Accounts are the property of the Province and may be cancelled by the Province at any time and for any reason without any notice or liability to you or any other person. The Province is not under any obligation to verify the actual identity or authority of any person using the Token or accessing any User Account.</p>
