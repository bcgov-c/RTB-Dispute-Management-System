  <p>I have reviewed all documentary evidence and in accordance with sections 88 and 90 of the Act, I find that the tenant was deemed/personally served with the 10 Day Notice on —---m, d, y----, three days after its posting.</p>
  <p>I find that the tenant was obligated to pay the monthly rent in the amount of $---.--, as per the tenancy agreement.</p>
  <p>I accept the evidence before me that the tenant has failed to pay the rent owed in full within the five days granted under section 46(4) of the Act and did not dispute the 10 Day Notice within that five day period.</p>
  <p>Based on the foregoing, I find that the tenant is conclusively presumed under sections 46(5) and 53(2) of the Act to have accepted that the tenancy ended on the corrected effective date of the 10 Day Notice, Month Day, Year.</p>
  <p>Therefore, I find that the landlord is entitled to an Order of Possession and a monetary award in the amount of $---.--, the amount claimed by the landlord, for unpaid rent owing for ----month/year---- as of —---m, d, y----.</p>
  <p>------ keep / remove if filing fee awarded ---- As the landlord was successful in this application, I find that the landlord is entitled to recover the $100.00 filing fee paid for this application.</p>
