To determine the materiality of a term during a dispute resolution hearing, the Residential Tenancy Branch will focus upon the importance of the term in the Page: 6 overall scheme of the tenancy agreement, as opposed to the consequences of the breach. It falls to the person relying on the term to present evidence and argument supporting the proposition that the term was a material term. The question of whether or not a term is material is determined by the facts and circumstances surrounding the creation of the tenancy agreement in question. It is possible that the same term may be material in one agreement and not material in another. Simply because the parties have put in the agreement that one or more terms are material is not decisive. During a dispute resolution proceeding, the Residential Tenancy Branch will look at the true intention of the parties in determining whether or not the clause is material.</p><p>Section 5 of the Act states that landlords and tenants may not avoid or contract out of this Act or regulation. Any attempt to avoid or contract out of the Act or regulation is of no effect. I find that the Park Rules are identified as being "material" to the tenancy.

              "conversationalAct": "<p>Section 49(6) of the Act states that a landlord may end a tenancy if the landlord has all necessary permits and approvals required by law, and intends in good faith to demolish the rental unit or convert it to another use. Section 49(8)(b) of the Act states that upon receipt of a Notice to End Tenancy for Demolition, or Conversion of Rental Unit to Another Use the tenant may, within 30 days, dispute the notice by filing an application for dispute resolution with the Residential Tenancy Branch. If the tenant files an application to dispute the notice, the landlord bears the burden to prove the grounds for the Four Month Notice. As the tenant disputed this notice on **MnthDayYear, and since I have found that the Four Month Notice was served to the tenant on **MnthDayYear, I find that the tenant has applied to dispute the Four Month Notice within the time frame allowed by section 49 of the Act.</p><p>RTB Policy Guideline #2 states that when a landlord ends a tenancy under section 49(6), they must have the permits or approvals required by law before they can give the tenant notice and that it is not sufficient to give notice while in the process of or prior to obtaining permits or approvals. The Guideline further states that if no permits or approvals are required by law, the landlord should obtain written proof of this.</p><p>**InsertBelowIfGoodFaithIsBeingQuestionedAndDeleteThisLine<br>The tenants dispute that the Notice is being issued in good faith. \"Good faith\" is a legal concept and means that a party is acting honestly when doing what they say they are going to do, or are required to do, under the Act. It also means there is no intent to defraud, act dishonestly or avoid obligations under the legislation or the tenancy agreement.</p><p>In Gichuru v. Palmar Properties Ltd. (2011 BCSC 827) the Supreme Court of British Columbia held that a claim of good faith requires honesty of intention with no ulterior motive. The landlord must honestly intend to use the rental unit for the purposes stated on the notice to end tenancy. To reiterate, when the issue of an ulterior motive or purpose for ending a tenancy is raised, the onus is on the landlord to establish that they are acting in good faith (see Baumann v. Aarti Investments Ltd., 2018 BCSC 636). In disputes where a tenant argues that the landlord is not acting in good faith, the tenant may substantiate that claim with evidence.</p>",
