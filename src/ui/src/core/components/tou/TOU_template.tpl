<p>You must agree to these Terms of Use before using the Residential Tenancy Branch's dispute management system.</p>

<p><b>What am I agreeing to by using the Residential Tenancy Branch's (RTB) online services?</b></p>
<p>By using RTB's online intake and dispute access site (together, "dispute management system") you agree to these terms of use ("Terms of Use") and you agree that you have read and understood them. The Government of British Columbia (the "Province", which for the purposes of these Terms of Use includes its employees, agents, and contractors) may change these Terms of Use from time to time. It is your responsibility to check for changes. Your continued use of the dispute management system after any changes to the Terms of Use will mean that you acknowledge, agree, and accept those changes.</p>


<p><b>How will my personal information be protected?</b></p>
<p>The Province is committed to protecting your privacy. The Province collects, uses, and discloses your personal information only in accordance with the&nbsp;<i>Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act</i>&nbsp;("FOIPPA") and other applicable law.</p>
<p>The RTB removes personal or identifying information before making a final decision available to the public. If you are concerned that information in a final decision or order would be harmful to your or another party's privacy or security, you may request that this information be redacted or anonymized by contacting the RTB information services at 1-800-665-8779.</p>
<p>The management of personal information is described more fully on the Province's&nbsp;<a href="javascript:;" class="static-external-link" url="http://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/home/privacy">Privacy Policy page</a>.</p>


<p><b>What information does the Residential Tenancy Branch collect and use?</b></p>
<p>The RTB only asks for information that is needed to resolve a dispute. The information that you provide will be linked to your file to facilitate the resolution of your dispute.</p>
<p>The RTB is authorized to collect the following types of information, and share it with the parties to the dispute:
<ul>
<li>contact information for the parties and their representatives, including names, addresses, telephone numbers, fax numbers, and email addresses</li>
<li>the address of the rental unit or manufactured home</li>
<li>rental agreement details, including the amount of rent</li>
<li>each party's description of the dispute</li>
<li>communications between the parties and the RTB</li>
<li>information and evidence submitted by the parties, which may include information about damages and injuries, financial records, and other personal information</li>
<li>information about witnesses, including their contact information and evidence they might be called upon to provide</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>The RTB is also authorized to collect information from a party about special circumstances relating to their RTB file, such as capacity issues or the ability to pay RTB fees. This information will not normally be shared with other parties unless the RTB is legally required to do so.</p>
<p>To assign an application to the appropriate RTB office, the RTB uses a geocoding service in Google Maps to find the geographic coordinates of the rental unit or manufactured home. The RTB may also collect data about dispute management system website traffic for the purposes of research, planning, reporting, and optimizing usage.</p>
<p>By using the dispute management system, you agree and consent to the Province's collection and use of information, including personal information, for the purposes set out in these Terms of Use.</p>
